NAME
    Dist::Zilla::Plugin::Prereqs::Soften - Downgrade listed dependencies to
    recommendations if present.

VERSION
    version 0.003001

SYNOPSIS
        [Prereqs::Soften]
        module = Foo
        module = Bar

    This module iterates "build", "require" and "test" dependency lists and
    migrates dependencies found in ".requires" and demotes them to
    ".recommends"

    Optionally, it can duplicate softened dependencies to other locations

ATTRIBUTES
  "modules"
    A "multi-value" argument that specifies a module name to soften in
    "prereqs".

  "to_relationship"
    The output relationship kind.

    Default:

        'recommends'

    Valid Values:

        'recommends', 'suggests', 'requires', 'conflicts'

    Though the last two are reserved for people with "$num_feet > 2" or with
    shotguns that only fire blanks.

  "copy_to"
    Additional places to copy the dependency to:

    Default:

        []

    Example:

        [Prereqs::Soften]
        copy_to         = develop.requires
        to_relationship = recommends
        module          = Foo

    This in effect means:

        remove from: runtime.requires
            → add to: develop.requires
            → add to: runtime.recommends

        remove from: test.requires
            → add to: develop.requires
            → add to: test.recommends

         remove from: build.requires
            → add to: develop.requires
            → add to: build.recommends
